# Hooks are per-clone and never travel with a push, so every machine that
# commits to this repo needs this. The CI check in
# .github/workflows/redaction-check.yml is the backstop for machines that skip
# it, and for merges made in the web UI where no hook can run.
#
# NOTE: this sets core.hooksPath for this repository, which overrides any
# global core.hooksPath. The commit-msg hook shipped here carries the same
# AI-attribution check as the global one, so nothing is lost.
