# SNAP-issues

This repository was created to provide a public location to record and display the status of "issues" for the SNAP application.  The SNAP developers will acknowledge, provide (and maybe request) feedback on the reported issues, and in general use the information to improve SNAP code.

**NOTE:** 
1. You MUST have a GitHub account to submit an issue!  

2. GitHub accounts are *free* (assuming all you want to do is provide issue feedback).

If you would like to report and issue or request a feature for SNAP but do not want to sign up for a GitHub account (FYI: they are free!) you may instead contact [Chester Gingrich, the NRC SNAP project manager](NRCgg), and ask him to track the issue for you.

Go directly to the [issues](https://github.com/NRC-Research/SNAP-issues/issues).
